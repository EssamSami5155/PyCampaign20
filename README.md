During the Corona outbreak, my school was closed for about 5 months. At that time, while I was feeling bored sitting in front of my desk, suddenly an idea banged into my head. I thought my classmates might be bored too. Why don't I talk with them and teach them programming? Then I discussed my idea with some of them. All appreciated the idea and they were eagerly wanting to learn to program. So, I organized PyCampaign20 where I took online 16 classes in 2 months in Zoom. In this campaign, I have guided them on how to start a career as a Python Developer and I also taught them the Basics of Python Programming. The mentoring project was produced by The AS8 organization.

Though the campaign is ended, you can also take part in the PyCampaign20 if you are interested enough to start your coding journey with Python in this lockdown period.
Also if you are from different programming languages, you can learn Python Basics from here.
Here's what you have to do:
  * Download and Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in your device.
  * [Download](https://github.com/ahammadshawki8/PyCampaign20.git) the repository in your device.
  * Open the [Syllabus.pdf](https://github.com/ahammadshawki8/PyCampaign20/blob/master/%231%20Syllabus.pdf) file.
  * Read all the pycampaign files according to the syllabus and practice coding daily.
  * After completing all the campaign (except the last pycampaign16 file) files, open [Problems.pdf](https://github.com/ahammadshawki8/PyCampaign20/blob/master/%232%20Problems.pdf).
  * Solve all the problems and [mail](mailto:ahammadshawki8@gmail.com) me the solutions.
  * Read [pycampaign[career_talk + future programming plans]](https://github.com/ahammadshawki8/PyCampaign20/blob/master/pycampaign16%5Bcareer_talk%20%2B%20future%20programming%20plans%5D.txt) and follow the advice.
  
Congratulations! Now you know the basics of Python and have next 3 years plan in your hand. So, what is stopping you to explore the programming world? The more you go into the deep the more you will amaze. Thank you for being a part of PyCampaign20.
